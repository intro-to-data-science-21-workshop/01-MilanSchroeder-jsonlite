## What is JSON?
- **JavaScript Object Notation**: 
  - Is a standard open file and data interchange format 
  - uses human readable text to store and transmit data objects.
  - It is a common data format with diverse uses particularly in electronic data interchange like web applications with servers

## Benefits of using JSON
- JSON is a "fat-free alternative" to XML
- It has easy syntax
- It is mostly used in web API's and for web development 
- It's supported across operating systems, browsers, and programming languages

- **Most importantly for us**: JSON is a great tool for sharing data of any size, even audio or videos as it stores the data in arrays

## History of JSON
.pull-left[
- Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format in the early 2000's.
- He popularized it with Chip Morningstar and with State Software who helped in the early stages of the development 
- It was eventually sold to Sun Microsystems, Amazon, EDS. 
- The JSON.org site went live in 2002 and Yahoo started offering some of their web services in JSON
- Fun fact: Crockford added a clause in the JSON license stating that "The software shall be used for Good and not evil" in order to keep it open source and mock corporate lawyers.

# History of the jsonlite package
.pull-left[
- developed in 2014 by Jeroen Ooms, a research engineer at Berkeley Institute for Data Science

- aims to realize practical and consistent mapping between JSON data and R objects
- superseded `rjson` and `RJSONIO`, which led to inconsistent results in some instances
- was soon widely adopted across the data science community

# Data Structures in JSON

<br>

- **Object**
  - unordered list of key : value pairs
  - similar to a dictionary
  - can include all types of JSON structures
  
  
- **Array**
  - ordered sequence of values
  - similar to R's vector-class
  - datatype can be heterogeneous


- **Value**
  - no direct representation in R
  - one-element values are similar to vectors of length 1
  - but they can also consist of multiple elements

# Key functions: `fromJSON`

```{r fromJSONarray}
JSON_array <- '[1, true, null, "string"]'
fromJSON(JSON_array, simplifyVector = TRUE)
```


```{r fromJSONvalue}
JSON_object <- 
'[
{"key": "value", "one": 1, "any_questions?": false},
{"key": null, "one": "NA", "any_questions?": true}
]'
fromJSON(JSON_object, simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)
```

---

# Key functions: `toJSON`

```{r toJSON}
starwars %>% slice_sample(n = 1) %>% 
  toJSON(pretty = T)
```

---

## Potential Issues: Dealing with NAs

R knows different `NA`-values, but JSON only has `null` to represent those...

- By default, `NA`'s are treated as strings (in numeric vectors)
  - so the string is no longer homogeneous, cause errors in statistical operations
  - but all information is preserved 
  
```{r}
(toJSON(c(3.14, NA, NaN, 42, Inf, -Inf)))
```
  
- You can choose to represent them as null
  - keeping the vector numeric
  - but loosing information

```{r}
(toJSON(c(3.14, NA, NaN, 42, Inf, -Inf), na = "null"))

```



---

## Potential Issues: Converting back and forth

- Note that there is no guaranteed one-to-one correspondence of R and JSON objects:
  - it will still be the encoded data
  - but ordering, class, etc. may differ

```{r}
(example <- slice_sample(starwars[1:6], n = 2))
fromJSON(toJSON(example[1:6]))
```

---

## Two more functions from the package:

If you - for whatever reason - need it to be consistent, use `(un)serializeJSON` instead

```{r}
unserializeJSON(serializeJSON(example[1:5]))
```

<br>


This allows you to convert back and get the exact same structure back...

---

## Two more functions from the package:
...But it comes with a downside: 
The JSON structure has to be much harder to read (or transfer to other languages), to perfectly resemble the original...

```{r}
serializeJSON(example, pretty = TRUE)
```
