### Get to know the package and data type:

First, we have to load the package:
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      error = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      comment = TRUE)
```


```{r load_json}
# if necessary: 
# install.packages("jsonlite")
# install.packages("RJSONIO")
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(RJSONIO)
```

First, what does JSON actually look like?


Simplification is the process where JSON arrays automatically get converted from a list into a more specific R class. The fromJSON function has 3 arguments which control the simplification process: simplifyVector, simplifyDataFrame and simplifyMatrix. Each one is enabled by default.

```{r writeJSON}
# We can write own JSON data (just for demonstration):

todays_instructors <-
'[
{
"Name": "Milan",
"Age": 25,
"Programme": "MIA",
"Likes_IDS_class": "true"
},
{
"Name": "Sangeeth",
"Age": 25,
"Programme": "MPP",
"Likes_IDS_class": "NA"
}
]'
```

Remember the chart from our presentation?
<img src="https://www.json.org/img/object.png" height=440>
That's exactly what we did here!

```{r isJSON}
RJSONIO::isValidJSON(todays_instructors, 
                     asText = T)
# note that if we would e.g. have forgotten some "", it wouldn't be a valid JSON object.
```

Our Data is actually a valid JSON object!

```{r}
print(todays_instructors)
```

Not very easy to read (or use) as raw text... let's convert it (using one of two key functions of the 'jsonlite' package: 'fromJSON')

```{r}
(not_simplified <- jsonlite::fromJSON(todays_instructors, 
                                      simplifyDataFrame = F))
```

Looks somehow familiar?!
It's basically the structure of a (named) list in R 


```{r}
str(not_simplified)
```

More specifically, it's a list of 2 which each represent lists of each key-value pair

...but it's still rather difficult to access (especially if you want multiple values...)

```{r example_access}
not_simplified[[1]]$Likes_IDS_class
```

## short excurse: 'RJSONIO'

Just to show that there is another package that deals with JSON data in R:

The 'RJSONIO' package also has a command called 'fromJSON', which gives us a slightly different structure:

```{r}
(alternative_list <- RJSONIO::fromJSON(todays_instructors, 
                                       simplify = T))
str(alternative_list)
```

This gives us a list of 2 named vectors... that looks very much like a dataframe... and can easily be transformed:

```{r}
as.data.frame(alternative_list)
# unload RJSONIO package, to avoid confusion of functions:
detach("package:RJSONIO")
```
But: it's a 4x2 dataframe, with variables as rows and cases as columns... not what R would usually expect. So better stick to 'jsonlite'

## back to 'jsonlite'


We can do for the first list from 'jsonlite'´s 'fromJSON':

```{r}
bind_rows(not_simplified[[1]] %>% 
            as_data_frame(), 
          not_simplified[[2]] %>% 
            as_data_frame())
```

... but both is rather lengthy...

Luckily, 'jsonlite' allows us to do all that in just one step, using the 'simplified' option (which is also set to 'true' by default!)

```{r}
(simplified <- jsonlite::fromJSON(todays_instructors, 
                                  simplifyDataFrame = T)) 
```


... And JSON can store more complex structures like nested objects:

Think of them as lists, that may contain, values, vectors, dataframes, or even other lists.

```{r create_nested}
nested_object <- 
'[
{
"value": 42,
"array": [1,2],
"array": [99,98],
"matrix": [[1,2],[3,4]],
"list": {"first": 42, "second": 3.141593, "last": "MMXXI", "addition": {"another list": ["a", "b", "C"]}}
},
{
"something": [99,-10],
"value": 33,
"array": [3,4,5,6]
}
]'

# Note that "array" occurs twice in one object. The second entry is just ignored when converted!
```

But can we change this structure to a dataframe, too?

```{r nested}
(nested_df <- fromJSON(nested_object))
nested_df$array
nested_df$matrix
nested_df$list
```






# Second key command: 'toJSON'

We can convert objects from JSON, so of course we also can convert them back:

```{r toJSON}
## Change data frame to JSON
(not_pretty <- toJSON(starwars, pretty = FALSE)) # that's the default!
(pretty <- starwars %>% toJSON(pretty = TRUE)) # but that's much nicer!
```






# See it in Action

Let's try it out, using the ([GitHub API](https://api.github.com/)):

```{r}
(workshops = jsonlite::fromJSON("https://api.github.com/orgs/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop/repos"))
```

Let's see what's in it...

```{r}
names(workshops)
```

We can call, index, or select variables, just as in any dataframe in R!

```{r}
workshops$name 
workshops[[10]]
workshops %>% select(name, description, updated_at)
```

They all sound super interesting, so **make sure to check them out**!





# Now it's your turn!

try to load the data in the folder, manipulate it (either in JSON-Format or converted to a tibble), and convert it back!

try for example: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex
or use the 'palmerpenguins::penguins', or 'cars'  dataset.

```{r}
# Your code here:
```
