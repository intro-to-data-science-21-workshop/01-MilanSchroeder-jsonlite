### Get to know the package and data type:

First, we have to load the package:

```{r load_json}
# if necessary: 
# install.packages("jsonlite")
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
```

First, what does JSON actually look like?
We can write own JSON object (just for demonstration):

```{r writeJSON}
todays_instructors <-
'[
{
"Name": "Milan",
"Age": 25,
"Programme": "MIA",
"Likes_IDS_class": "true"
},
{
"Name": "Sangeeth",
"Age": 25,
"Programme": "MPP",
"Likes_IDS_class": null
}
]'
```

Remember the chart from our presentation?
<img src="https://www.json.org/img/object.png" height=440>

That's exactly what we did here!

```{r isJSON}
jsonlite::validate(todays_instructors)
# note that if we would e.g. have forgotten some "", it wouldn't be a valid JSON object.
# whitespaces and indentation may be used arbitrarily
```

Our Data is actually a valid JSON object! So let's see what we can do with that...

```{r}
print(todays_instructors)
```

Not very easy to read (or use) as raw text... let's convert it!

# First key command: `fromJSON`

```{r}
(not_simplified <- jsonlite::fromJSON(todays_instructors, 
                                      simplifyDataFrame = F))
```

Looks somehow familiar?!
It's basically the structure of a (named) list in R 


```{r}
str(not_simplified)
```

More specifically, it's a list of 2 which each represent lists of all 4 key-value pairs

...but it's still rather difficult to access (especially if you want multiple values...)

```{r example_access}
not_simplified[[1]]$Likes_IDS_class
```

We can transform it to a dataframe manually:

```{r}
# but we would have to recode null-values before, because they can not be interpreted as arrays usually: 
not_simplified[[2]]$Likes_IDS_class <- NA

bind_rows(not_simplified[[1]] %>% 
            as_data_frame(), 
            not_simplified[[2]] %>% 
            as_data_frame())
```

... but that is rather lengthy...

Luckily, `jsonlite` allows us to do all that in just one step, using the `simplify*` options:

Simplification is the process where JSON arrays automatically get converted from a list into a more specific R class. 
The fromJSON function has 3 arguments which control the simplification process: `simplifyVector`, `simplifyDataFrame` and `simplifyMatrix`. 
Each one is enabled by default.


```{r}
(simplified <- jsonlite::fromJSON(todays_instructors, 
                                  simplifyDataFrame = T)) 
```


... And JSON can store more complex structures like nested objects:

Think of them as lists, that may contain, values, vectors, dataframes, or even other lists.

```{r create_nested}
nested_object <- 
'[
{
"value": 42,
"array": [1,2],
"array": [99,98],
"matrix": [[1,2],[3,4]],
"list": {"first": 42, 
         "second": 3.141593, 
         "last": "MMXXI", "addition": 
        {"another list": ["a", "b", "C"]}}
},
{
"something": [99,-10],
"value": 33,
"array": [3,4,5,6]
}
]'

# Note that "array" occurs twice in one object. The second entry is just ignored when converted!
```

But can we change this structure to a dataframe, too?

```{r nested}
(nested_df <- fromJSON(nested_object))
nested_df$array
nested_df$matrix
nested_df$list

jsonlite::flatten(nested_df)
```






# Second key command: `toJSON`

We can convert objects from JSON, so of course we also can convert them back:

```{r toJSON}
## Change data frame to JSON
(not_pretty <- starwars %>% slice_sample(n = 3) %>% toJSON(pretty = FALSE)) # that's the default!
(pretty <- starwars %>% slice_sample(n = 3) %>% toJSON(pretty = TRUE)) # but that's much nicer!
```






# See it in Action

Let's try it out, using the ([GitHub API](https://api.github.com/)):

```{r}
(workshops = jsonlite::fromJSON("https://api.github.com/orgs/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop/repos"))
```

Let's see what's in it...

```{r}
names(workshops)
```

We can call, index, or select variables, just as in any dataframe in R!

```{r}
workshops$name 
workshops[[10]]
workshops %>% select(name, description, updated_at)
```

They all sound super interesting, so **make sure to check them out**!





# Now it's your turn!

try to load some JSON data, convert and manipulate it, and convert it back!

try for example: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex, check out your own GitHub page via API, or use the `palmerpenguins::penguins`, or `cars` dataset.

There are literally millions of interesting databases on the Web (see https://github.com/jdorfman/Awesome-JSON-Datasets), so pick something that interests you!

```{r}
# Your code here:
```
